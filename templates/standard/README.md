# Documentation Guide

## Overview
This folder contains documentation for the project. These documents help provide structure and guidance for development, especially when using AI-assisted coding methods like vibe coding.

## Files

### PRD (prd.md)
The Product Requirements Document (PRD) is the primary document that captures all project requirements. This serves as the source of truth for your project.

### Instructions (instructions.md)
AI-optimized guidance for code generation tools. This is what you'll refer to when using AI coding assistants.

### User Stories (user-stories.md)
Structured user narratives that clarify how users will interact with your software.

### Design Document (design-doc.md)
Technical architecture and visual design specifications.

## Workflow

1. Fill in your PRD with project requirements
2. Use the MCP tools to validate your PRD and ensure it's complete
3. Generate derived documents using the MCP tools
4. As your project evolves, update your PRD and use the update-docs tool

## Maintenance

Keep these documents updated as your project evolves. The PRD should always reflect the current state of your project requirements.
