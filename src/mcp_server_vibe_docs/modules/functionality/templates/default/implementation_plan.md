# Implementation Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for your project.

## Phase 1: Setup & Core Architecture
- [ ] Set up project repository and basic structure
- [ ] Configure development environment
- [ ] Design database schema
- [ ] Create basic API structure

## Phase 2: API Implementation
- [ ] Implement authentication system
- [ ] Develop core data models
- [ ] Create CRUD endpoints for primary resources
- [ ] Add validation and error handling
- [ ] Implement business logic for core features

## Phase 3: Frontend Development
- [ ] Set up frontend framework and structure
- [ ] Create UI components
- [ ] Implement API integration
- [ ] Build user flows and navigation
- [ ] Add state management

## Phase 4: Testing & Refinement
- [ ] Write unit tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Create integration tests for key flows
- [ ] Conduct user testing and gather feedback
- [ ] Optimize performance
- [ ] Fix bugs and refine features

## Phase 5: Deployment & Launch
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Configure production environment
- [ ] Deploy application
- [ ] Monitor performance and errors
- [ ] Gather initial user feedback

## Next Steps for Development

To get started with development:

1. Review the features document and prioritize implementation
2. Start by implementing the core API endpoints
3. Build frontend components that interact with these endpoints
4. Test each feature thoroughly before moving to the next

Remember to update this plan as your project evolves!
