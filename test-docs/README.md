# Documentation Guide

## Overview
This folder contains documentation for the project. These documents help provide structure and guidance for development, especially when using AI-assisted coding methods like vibe coding.

## Files

### PRD (prd.md)
The Product Requirements Document (PRD) is the primary document that captures all project requirements. This serves as the source of truth for your project.

### Instructions (instructions.md)
AI-optimized guidance for code generation tools. This is what you'll refer to when using AI coding assistants.

### User Stories (user-stories.md)
Structured user narratives that clarify how users will interact with your software.

### Design Document (design-doc.md)
Technical architecture and visual design specifications.

## Workflow

1. Fill in your PRD with project requirements
2. Run `vibe validate` to ensure your PRD is complete
3. Run `vibe generate` to create derived documents
4. As your project evolves, update your PRD and run `vibe update`

## Maintenance

Keep these documents updated as your project evolves. The PRD should always reflect the current state of your project requirements.
